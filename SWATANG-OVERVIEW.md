# SWATANG OVERVIEW

## Development Environment
- Node.js as an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.  
- NPM to manage packages.
- Angular CLI for create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.
- Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript.
- TypeScript language to implement optional functionality in Angular Framework.

## UI Layout / Components
Using Bootstrap to
  develop responsive layout, mobile-first web sites

- Builing common components for reuse source code
- Using `<outlet>` to optimize HTML layout
- Field validators are collected in a place as Field Specification for manage easily.
- Applying Lazy Load to reduce loading time of application for starting.
